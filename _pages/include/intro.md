Hi there! I am Zekai Shao, pursuing my Ph.D at the School of Data Science, Fudan University (FDU). supervised by Prof. [<font color=Black>Siming Chen</font>](http://simingchen.me/) and associated with [<font color=Black>FDU VIS</font>](http://fduvis.net/). I received my bachelor's degree with honor from Intelligent Science and Technology (Honored Class) in the School of Information and Science Technology of FDU in the summer of 2023, and started early doctoral studies and research after being selected for the FDU Elite Ph.D Program in 2022. Additionally, I'm honored to intern at MSRA advised by Dr. [<font color=Black>Yun Wang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangyun/) and [<font color=Black>Haidong Zhang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/haizhang/).

My research interest lies at the intersection of visualization, data science, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. I have delved into using visual analytics to assist experts in comprehending and enhancing AI models, as well as aiding general users in learning about AI models. Lately, my primary focus has been on visual storytelling powered by large language models.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via *<u>gemini25szk@gmail.com</u>*.
