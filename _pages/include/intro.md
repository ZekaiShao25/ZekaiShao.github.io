Hi there! I am Zekai Shao, a Ph.D candidate in the School of Data Science at Fudan University (FDU), supervised by Prof. [<font color=Black>Siming Chen</font>](http://simingchen.me/) and associated with [<font color=Black>FDU-VIS</font>](http://fduvis.net/). I received my bachelor's degree with honor from Intelligent Science and Technology (Honored Class) in the School of Information and Science Technology at FDU in the summer of 2023. Additionally, I'm honored to intern at MSRA advised by Dr. [<font color=Black>Yun Wang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangyun/) and [<font color=Black>Haidong Zhang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/haizhang/).

My research interest lies at the intersection of visualization, data science, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction. Currently, my primary focus has been on visualization evaluation and storytelling powered by large models. I also have delved into domain-specific visual analytics and general visual analytics frameworks.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via *<u>gemini25szk@gmail.com</u>*.
