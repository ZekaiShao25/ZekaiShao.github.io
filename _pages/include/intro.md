Hello! I am Leixian Shen (沈磊贤), a Ph.D student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. [<font color=Black>Huamin Qu</font>](http://www.huamin.org/), affiliated with [<font color=Black>VisLab</font>](http://vis.cse.ust.hk/). Prior to that, I received my master's degree with honor in School of Software at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [<font color=Black>Jianmin Wang</font>](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/jianminwang.htm). I have also taken a research internship at Microsoft Research Asia advised by Dr. [<font color=Black>Yun Wang</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/wangyun/).

My research interest is to leverage the intersection of Information Visualization (VIS), Data Science (DS), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to democratize visual data analysis and storytelling, especially on Human-AI Collaboration, AI for Visualization, Text-Visual Interplay, and Intelligent Data Visualization Creation.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me via *<u>lshenaj@connect.ust.hk</u>*.
